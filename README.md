### Neurons as logic gates
###### This is a Task project: Neurons can be used to model logic gates by applying an activation function, usually the sigmoid function, to a combination of inputs, input weights and a bias.

This task will complete the following:
- Work out what values would model an AND gate
- Do the same for the NOR gate and the NAND gate
- Combine the gates discussed
- Finish a version of an XOR gate that more closely resembles a neural
network by determining the shapes the weights and biases need to
have.
